# Appendix D – Federal Agency Data Pools

[**_Return to TOC_**](./2019_Coordination_Report.md)

Beside structured data, there is great potential in unstructured data pools among public agencies and within academia. Currently, most non-proprietary LCA data is posted on websites in differing formats (e.g., hidden within text reports or in the backend of online tools) with little to no public knowledge of where and/or how to access this data. Specialized LCA practitioners apply government agency data on a case-by-case basis. Experts are deliberating on how to organize existing public data to make it more useful to federal government, its partners, and other stakeholders. The most efficient way to approach this task is with public access and database interoperability in mind. The end goal would be a top-down approach for creating a linked open-data system.

Transforming these data pools into the LCI format and integrating the information into LCI databases will require a great initial effort. However, the work could be approached with the prevention of technical debt in mind. For instance, there is great potential to refine existing LCI data for electricity generation. The EPA compiles e-GRID data, which could be cross-checked with the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) and GREET data to provide more complete information. In some cases, this improvement includes facility-level data and regionalized air-quality models, the incorporation of which would support the regionalization of LCI data. Further, temporal data quality could be improved by using the compilation of required facility reporting data to populate temporal data gaps in existing LCI modules. The US EPA WAste Reduction Model (WARM) for landfills and other existing calculators need to be structured to fit the existing LCI database categorization scheme and elementary flow nomenclature. Once accomplished, the update to these existing data pools would automatically feed into the LCI modules.

Both existing LCI repositories and government data pools (with LCI-data-mining potential) need to be developed in a common format and available at one access point to be linkable. This &quot;linkability&quot; could enable a wealth of information and eventually, perhaps with machine learning, lead to linked information capabilities between agencies and other LCA resources (e.g., commercial, academic, and private). The long-term vision of the Federal LCA Commons Working Group is to set the stage for agile data and coordinate LCA synergism—a whole that is &quot;greater than the sum of its parts&quot;—from public data that could facilitate economy-wide, US-relevant analyses for decision-making.
