This report was compiled to provide information about the US Federal life cycle assessment (LCA) Data Commons, referred to in this report as the &quot;Federal LCA Commons.&quot; The Federal LCA Commons is not only a public data source but also a repository for data developed under Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy (EERE) programs. The Federal LCA Commons Working Group is working to improve the standardization of data documentation, formatting, and nomenclature to ensure lossless data loading and accurate data representation in the repository.

This report and appendices include the following:

1. An introduction to LCA within EERE programs
2. The current status of the Federal LCA Commons
3. Opportunities for the Federal LCA Commons to support EERE goals and objectives

To date, the Federal LCA Commons is the result of coordinated work by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Energy Technology Library (NETL), the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the US Forest Service (USFS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST).

The Federal LCA Commons will continue to combine databases from the collaboratingagencies while remaining a public resource. There are several initiatives among the collaborating agencies to expand the Federal LCA Commons
