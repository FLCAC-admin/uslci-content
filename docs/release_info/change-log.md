This change log contains a summary of changes to the [U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database (USLCI)](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory/USLCI_Public/datasets).  The USLCI is updated quarterly based on the [U.S. Federal Government Fiscal Calendar](https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/fiscal_year.htm).

###### Table 1. USLCI Change Log

| **Release** | **File Type** | **Change Type** | **File Name** | **UUID** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FY24.Q2.01 | Flows and folders   | Database | Realigned waste flows | - | Transitioned datasets using the opposite direct waste end-of-life methodology to the material flow logic allocation to enhance the consistency of end-of-life modeling. (openLCA has updated waste modeling since the initial development of many USLCI processes. Waste treatment processes represent the impacts of processing a waste product, so these processes have impacts associated with them but they also represent a waste flow. The original modeling method was to include waste flows as product flows on the input side of the inventory (opposite direction approach), now waste flows are available to be used on the output side of the (material flow logic approach). This approach is much more intuitive and reduces modeling and database problems that have been associated with the opposite direction approach previously.) |
| FY24.Q2.01 | Flows | Consolidation | 5622: Waste Treatment and Disposal | -| Many of the waste flows in this folder were cutoff flows. These flows were renamed and consolidated into the CUTOFF Waste Flows folder |
| FY24.Q2.01 | Folders | Add | CUTOFF Waste Flows Folder | - | Added a cutoff waste flows folder as a subfolder to the CUTOFF Flows folder|
| FY24.Q2.01 | Library | Add | elci_6_2024 for uslci_q2_2024_final | - | Added the Electricity Baseline Repository as a library to USLCI. Connected the old Electricity, at grid flow to the Electricity Baseline flow referenced in the next entry. |
| FY24.Q2.01 | Flow | Add | Electricity, AC, 120 V | 3bca3bc6-2443-3184-8976-72dc98d258f6  | Added eLCI flow to USLCI to make automatic library connection. This flow replaced the electricity, at grid flow 06581fb2-1de0-3e78-8298-f37605dea142.|
| FY24.Q2.01 | Library | Edit | elci_6_2024 for uslci_q2_2024_final | -  | Adapted the Electricity Baseline repository to be compatible with USLCI |
