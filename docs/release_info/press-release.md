#### USLCI Conversion to the Federal Elementary FEDEFL-Adapted CED & LCIA Methods

Since Spring quarter 2020, the USLCI has converted to using the [Federal Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL)](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?dirEntryId=347251&Lab=NRMRL&subject=Land%20and%20Waste%20Management%20Research&showCriteria=0&searchAll=Waste%20Management%20or%20Nitrogen%20Management%20or%20Contaminated%20Sites%20or%20Ground%20Water%20or%20Materials%20Management%20or%20Sediment%20Toxicity&sortBy=revisionDate&startIndex=51&displayIt=Yes), which is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List) per the emerging Commons standards & conventions. The FEDEFL will become a part of the core database structure across Commons repositories and provide greater standardization and interoperability for Federal LCA data. Life cycle inventory (LCI) and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods are also being converted to be compatible with the FEDEFL being adapted by FLCAC. **For the convenience of end users of USLCI Database (and other FEDEFL-adapted FLCAC data), these [FEDEFL-Adapted Methods](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lcia-methods-without-flows) are provided for running LCI and LCIA calculations in openLCA.**

### A Note Regarding the US Electricity Baseline

Please note that the Federal LCA Commons has a new [landing page](https://www.lcacommons.gov/) from which you may _Browse Repositories_ if you want to explore other data becoming available from Federal LCA Commons (FLCAC) member agencies such as the [US Electricity Baseline](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search/page=1&group=Federal_LCA_Commons). There is a [USLCI Database Quick Help Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmIn8Hncs7bFUOyXZNGXwG4LtdoTfLz6Q) in which many topics are covered including how to link USLCI data to this baseline data and how to reflect USLCI Database updates without breaking these links.

### A Note Regarding Nomenclature

Depending on the version of the USLCI Database and the method you use to calculate results in the past, there have always been elementary flow nomenclature linking gaps. Now, however, these gaps have been largely addressed by aligning the Federal Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL) with FEDEFL-adapted methods (including TRACI). Being adapted to this more standardized and consistent elementary flow nomenclature system enables obtaining consistent life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results for USLCI datasets. Please see the [**FEDEFL-adapted methods**](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/wiki/FEDEFL-Adapted-LCI-&-LCIA-Methods) page on this GitHub site to download and import methods that properly link the USLCI flows to method nomenclature, associated factors, and thus, accurate capture of inventory totals and impacts. Using the FEDEFL in the inventory and making these FEDEFL-adapted methods available to the public eliminates the need for the nomenclature alignment work previously required for users not having a proprietary software license(s).

## 2020 Fall Quarter (Scheduled September 30, Occurred September 21; October 29)

This USLCI Database release is **Version 2** of the USLCI_2020_Q3 or Fall 2020 release. **USLCI_2020_Q3 Version 1** occurred September 21 to preceed _USLCI Resources Pre-Conference Workshop_ on September 21st at the [American Center for Life Cycle Assessment (ACLCA) 2020 Virtual Conference]([https://aclca.org/aclca-2020/](https://aclca.org/aclca-2020/)). This USLCI database version is available on the [NREL USLCI repo](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search/page=1&amp;amp;amp;group=National\_Renewable\_Energy\_Laboratory) of the [Federal LCA Commons Collaboration Server](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search) as well as via the [USLCI Release Downloads](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/release_info/release-downloads.md) page of this GitHub site. This release is intended as an augmentation to the normal fiscal quarter release scheduled for September 30, 2020 to align with several improvements going forward:

- Addition of ACC HDPE &amp; LLDPE virgin resin unit process updates

- Differentiation between unit &amp; system processes for chemicals &amp; resins

- Correction to some ambiguous and outdated elementary flows

- Improvements to process and product flow nomenclature standardization

From **USLCI_2020_Q3 Version 1** of the Fall release focused on energy &amp; electricity improvements:

- Default providers for **_Electricity, at grid_** were defined for all instances where this product flow is a process input in the USLCI Database. The US 2010 average grid mix process was used as the default provider in most instances as it is the latest available US average in the USLCI Database. Exceptions were to elect a Western or Eastern grid mix from 2014 as the default provider for some regional processes such as regional log yards and sawmills. You can still define any electricity provider you want for each process input instance of electricity but this ensures that a logical default is being used when running analyses in only the USLCI with no other linked database(s). You can bulk replace the default providers for this flow with one from the recently publish [US Electricity Baseline](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search/page=1&group=Federal_LCA_Commons) by following the procedure described in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFGk85HmtL4&amp;list=PLmIn8Hncs7bFUOyXZNGXwG4LtdoTfLz6Q&amp;index=7).
- Several energy conversion errors from **USLCI_2020_Q2 (Summer 2020)** release version were corrected, which mostly affects metals inventories. For instance, 8 exchanges of uranium inputs retained values intended to be in MJ but displayed in kilograms during a prior update. This was significantly affecting the non-renewable, nuclear LCI results of metals such as steel and aluminum in the USLCI and so has been corrected. There was also a steel scrap looping error that was corrected.

Please see the complete [Change Log](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/release\_info/change-log.md) for details of all Fall 2020 (Version 1 and 2) updates.

Additionally, please note that current and deleted datasets are always also available in an archive managed by NREL (wherein current and previous USLCI database versions are available) at the [USLCI Downloads Page](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/release\_info/release-downloads.md).

Finally, please see the [How to Publish in the USLCI](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/submission\_handbook/02-how-to-publish-in-the-uslci.md) section in the USLCI Data Submission Guidelines and/or contact the contact the [USLCI Data Curator](mailto:Rebe.Feraldi@lac-group.com) if you have any data/metadata publishing goals for the next December 31, 2020 Fall release date.

## 2020 Summer Quarter (Scheduled June 30, Occurred July 14)

This USLCI Database release occurred on July 14, 2020 to the USLCI database available on the [NREL USLCI repo](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search/page=1&amp;amp;group=National\_Renewable\_Energy\_Laboratory) of the [Federal LCA Commons Collaboration Server](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search), intended as the normal fiscal quarter release scheduled for June 30, 2020 to align with several improvements going forward:

- Correction to &quot;Petroleum refining, at refinery&quot; allocation factors &amp; product linking

- Update to ACC LDPE plastic resin data

- Update of USLCI forestry products nomenclature to match CORRIM repo for linking

- Augmented user rights &amp; and process-level data quality metadata for some processes

- Corrections to the following as noted in the [Spring Quarter Release Errata](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/release_info/press-release.md#2020-spring-quarter-release-errata):

  - Carbon dioxide emissions for **_Diesel, combusted in industrial boiler_** was on a _m3_ diesel output basis (2,727 _kg / m3_ diesel). However, the remainder of the exchanges for this process are on the basis of 1 _L_ diesel output. Please note the carbon dioxide emission factor was corrected to 2.727 _kg / L_ diesel output to match the units of the quantitative reference and other exchanges for this process.

  - For **_Transport, combination truck, diesel powered_**, corrected units of **_Diesel, at refinery_** inputs from _m3_ to _L_ per output of _t*km_ transport

  - For **_Steam, purchased by containerboard mills_**, corrected units of residual fuel oil inputs from _m3_ to _L_ and value from _gal_ to _L_; corrected natural gas value converted from _ft3_ to _m3_ (British units originally submitted)

  - For **_Transport, ocean freighter, residual fuel oil powered_**, corrected units of residual fuel oil inputs from _m3_ to _L_

  - For the following processes, a bug error caused the quantitative reference output to be eliminated from the process (not the database). These output products with their respective values, units, and exchange comments were reinstated to their respecitive processes:

    - Corrugated product, average production, at mill

    - Aluminum, primary ingot, at plant

    - Acetic acid, at plant

    - Ethanol, denatured, corn dry mill

    - Aluminum, secondary ingot, at plant

### A Note on Allocation Default Methods in oLCA

Using &#39;NONE&#39; or &#39;CAUSAL&#39; as the default allocation method, as designated by data providers in many USLCI multi-output processes, can produce unexpected LCI &amp; LCIA results in oLCA. The &#39;PHYSICAL&#39; and &#39;ECONOMIC&#39; default methods produce expected results. Further, selecting &#39;AS DEFINED IN PROCESS&#39; during calculations also produces expected results. See [this double counting thread on allocation](https://ask.openlca.org/2281/allocation-in-multifunctional-processes) and this [unit properties in allocation thread](https://github.com/GreenDelta/olca-app/issues/83) in the oLCA issues/Q&amp;A and GitHub Issues lists, respectively.

Until default allocation methods for multi-output processes in USLCI are adjusted and additional guidance is provided, NREL recommends using the &#39;AS DEFINED IN PROCESS&#39; default allocation when running calculations on USLCI data in oLCA.
<br>
### Reminder of FLCAC Adaptation of the Federal Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL) & TRACIv2.1

Since Spring quarter 2020, the USLCI is now the first repo on the [Federal LCA Commons (FLCAC)](https://www.lcacommons.gov/) to be compatible with the [Federal Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL)](https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List). The US EPA, the lead agency on the FEDEFL, worked with NREL to help map and convert the USLCI database to the FEDEFL. Per the emerging FLCAC standards & conventions, the FEDEFL will become a part of the core database structure across FLCAC repositories. The [CORRIM Forestry & Forestry Products](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search/page=1&group=CORRIM) database is in the process of being converted to the FEDEFL and other repos will follow. The FEDEFL will provide greater standardization and interoperability for Federal LCA data and can also serve as a standard for elementary flows for a broader community. 

Please note that there has also been a release of [TRACI 2.1 LCIA Method](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/US\_Environmental\_Protection\_Agency/TRACI) repo on the FLCAC server that is compatible to the FEDEFL. **This version of TRACI must be used in order to obtain results for life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) calculations on FLCAC data adapted to the FEDEFL (e.g., USLCI Database).** A repo with [ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint and Endpoint ](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search/page=1&amp;group=Federal_LCA_Commons)methods that are FEDEFL-compatible has also been published to the FLCAC.
<br>

For more information regarding any of these changes, contact the [USLCI Data Curator](mailto:Rebe.Feraldi@lac-group.com) or the [USLCI Administrator](mailto:lci@nrel.gov).

## 2020 Spring Quarter Release Errata

**Please NOTE: the following errors have been identified in the current USLCI Database version and will be corrected for release to the public database for the June 30 quarterly publication update:**
<br>
- The carbon dioxide emissions for **_Diesel, combusted in industrial boiler_** are on a m3 diesel output basis (2,727 kg / m3 diesel). However, the remainder of the exchanges for this process are on the basis of 1 L diesel output. Please note the carbon dioxide emission factor should be corrected to 2.727 kg / L diesel output to match the quantitative reference and other exchanges for this process.
- For **_Transport, combination truck, diesel powered_**, correct units of Diesel, at refinery inputs from m3 to L per output of t*km transport
- For **_Steam, purchased by containerboard mills_**, correct units of residual fuel oil inputs from m3 to L and value from gal to L; corrected natural gas value converted from ft3 to m3 (British units originally submitted)
- For **_Transport, ocean freighter, residual fuel oil powered_**, correct units of residual fuel oil inputs from m3 to L
- For **_Coil, coating, m2, at plant_**, correct units of Disposal, liquid wastes, unspecified to waste water treatment inputs from m3 to L
- For **_Cotton, whole plant, at field_**, change quantitative reference from cotton straw to cotton; correct diesel fuel combusted in industrial boiler inputs unit from m3 to L
- For **_Potato, whole plant, at field_**, change quantitative reference from potato leaves to potatos; correct diesel fuel combusted in industrial boiler inputs unit from m3 to L
<br>

- For the following processes, a bug error caused the quantitative reference output to be eliminated. These outputs will be reinstated at the June 30 update. For now, please note that they are currently without the correct main product:
  - Corrugated product, average production, at mill
  - Aluminum, primary ingot, at plant
  - Acetic acid, at plant
  - Ethanol, denatured, corn dry mill
  - Aluminum, secondary ingot, at plant
  - Steel, stainless 304, scrap
  - Pulp, kraft market, bleached, average production, at mill
  - Wood Combusted, at boiler, at cellulosic fiberboard mill
  
Until the June 30 update, to determine the correct quantity for the output and/or read comments for these flows, please refer to the previous [USLCI Database version from Fall Interim Release 2019](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/release_info/release-downloads.md#table-1-uslci-release-downloads), i.e., FY2019.Q4.02 in whichever file format you prefer.

## 2020 Spring Quarter (Scheduled March 31, Occurred April 24)

This USLCI Database release occurred on April 24, 2020 to the USLCI database available on the [NREL USLCI repo](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search/page=1&amp;group=National\_Renewable\_Energy\_Laboratory) of the [Federal LCA Commons Collaboration Server](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search), intended as the normal fiscal quarter release scheduled for March 31, 2020 to align with several improvements going forward:

- Addition of 4 processes for asphalt binder from the Asphalt Institute
- Corrections to units for volume and energy units for liquid fuels and electricity exchanges, respectively
- Improvements to the USLCI adaptation of the Federal Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL)

Please see the complete [Change Log](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/release\_info/change-log.md) for details.

Please note that the Federal LCA Commons has a new [landing page](https://www.lcacommons.gov/) from which you may _"Browse Repositories"_ if you want to explore other data becoming available from Federal LCA Commons (FLCAC) member agencies.

Additionally, please see the [How to Publish in the USLCI](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/submission\_handbook/02-how-to-publish-in-the-uslci.md) section in the USLCI Data Submission Guidelines and/or contact the contact the [USLCI Data Curator](mailto:Rebe.Feraldi@lac-group.com) if you have any data/metadata publishing goals for the next June 30, 2020 Summer release date. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

<br>

**Asphalt Binder Datasets**

Life cycle inventory (LCI) data for four (4) new processes were added to the USLCI:

  1) [Asphalt binder, 0.5% polyphosphoric acid (PPA), consumption mix, at terminal, from crude oil, 0.5% polyphosphoric acid](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory/USLCI/dataset/PROCESS/28d7d56e-a751-492c-9bb1-08f19ea4ac37)
  2) [Asphalt binder, 3.5% styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), consumption mix, at terminal, from crude oil, 3.5% styrene-butadiene-styrene](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory/USLCI/dataset/PROCESS/bbf3dc45-a370-405e-8996-7358b7f1841c)
  3) [Asphalt binder, 8% ground rubber tire (GRT), consumption mix, at terminal, from crude oil, 8% ground rubber tire](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory/USLCI/dataset/PROCESS/72d5a381-8cae-4e1d-b0a3-26cc43b69867)
  4) [Asphalt binder, no additives, consumption mix, at terminal, from crude oil](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory/USLCI/dataset/PROCESS/f8ce5199-1666-452b-a267-8797c94d0560)

These data were compiled by [Sphera](https://sphera.com/) LCA consultants (who [recently acquired ThinkStep](https://sphera.com/news/sphera-signs-agreement-to-acquire-thinkstep/)) for the [Asphalt Institute](http://asphaltinstitute.org/). The LCA Report is available [here](http://www.asphaltinstitute.org/engineering/lca-study-on-asphalt-binders/). 

The product boundary begins with crude oil input to the refinery and ends at the asphalt terminal. Refining steps relevant to the production of asphalt binder include atmospheric distillation and vacuum distillation. The LCI data are system-level and represent the annual industry average for the US and Canada for 12 consecutive months during the 2015 and 2016 calendar years.

Please see the process metadata and/or the report for more information.

**Liquid Fuel & Electricity Unit Corrections:**

Over 1800 exchanges in the USLCI were corrected to reflect the correct units for 22 liquid fuels and chemicals and 54 electricity products due to a non-universal database units error at flow exchanges (i.e., many volume units were in cubic meters needing adjustment to liters and many electricity exchanges were in MJ units needing adjustment to kWh). This database error occurred in Spring quarter 2019 and was detected Winter 2019. Partial corrections were made (to transport modules) for the last Mid-Quarter update and the rest corrected this Spring 2020 quarter. USLCI end-users should use the 2020 USLCI database version to adjust models accordingly.

The volume units error was causing artificial over-estimation of fuel requirements (by factor of 1000 L-to-m3 conversion) for some but not all of the exchanges for the following liquid chemicals and fuels:

-  Acetone, liquid
-  Butyl acetate, liquid
-  Disposal, liquid waste, unspecified to waste water treatment
-  Ethanol, denatured, corn stover, biochemical
-  Gasoline, used in personal vehicle
-  Isobutyl acetate, liquid
-  Naphtha, at regional storage

-  Liquefied petroleum gas, at refinery
-  Liquefied petroleum gas, combusted in industrial boiler
-  LPG, combusted in industrial boiler, at pulp and paper mill (EXCL.)
-  Natural gas, combusted in industrial equipment
-  Residual fuel oil, at refinery
-  Residual fuel oil, combusted in industrial boiler
-  RFO, combusted in industrial boiler, at pulp and paper mill (EXCL.)


The energy units error was causing under-estimation of energy requirements (by a factor of 3.6 MJ-to-kWh conversion) for electricity at many processes:

- Electricity from hydro
- Electricity, alumina refining regions
- Electricity, aluminum smelting and ingot casting regions
- Electricity, anthracite coal, at power plant
- Electricity, at bauxite mining regions

**Federal Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL)**

This release corrected some elementary flows according to the Federal Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL). Some water emissions to water flows were being erroneously used as input exchanges so these flows were converted to be 'resource' flows as intended.

Please note that there has been a release of [TRACI 2.1 LCIA Method](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/US\_Environmental\_Protection\_Agency/TRACI) repo on the FLCAC server using the FEDEFL, enabling the use of the TRACI 2.1 method on USLCI compatible with the implementation of the FEDEFL.

The US EPA, the lead agency on the FEDEFL, worked with NREL to help map and convert the USLCI data to the FEDEFL. The USLCI is the first large Federal LCA Commons (FLCAC) dataset to use the FEDEFL. The FEDEFL will become a part of the core database structure across FLCAC repositories. The FEDEFL will provide greater standardization and interoperability for Federal LCA data and can also serve as a standard for elementary flows for a broader community.




For more information regarding any of these changes, contact the [USLCI Data Curator](mailto:Rebe.Feraldi@lac-group.com) or the [USLCI Administrator](mailto:lci@nrel.gov).

## 2019 Winter Quarter (December 31)


The USLCI quarterly update slated for December 31 occurred on January 1, 2020. Several improvements, reviesions, and deltions were implemented to the database available on the [NREL USLCI repo](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search/page=1&group=National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory) of the [Federal LCA Commons Collaboration Server](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search) including:

  * The word "CUTOFF" has been removed from technospheric flows not having a producing process in the USLCI; however, all cutoff flows are categorized in the same Flows\Technosphere Flows\CUTOFF Flows folder and display within processes with this categorization, which helps identify provenance.
  *  Over 19,000 orphan flows have been identified and eliminated from the USLCI (i.e., those not linked to any exchanges)
  *  Updated PET data (and supply chain links) from NAPCOR/ACC are now available
  *  Several flows erroneously categorized as an 'elementary-type' flow have been corrected to display as technosphere-type' or 'waste-type' flows and categorized in the Flows\Technosphere Flows folder accordingly.
  *  A new folder with 'technosphere-type' flows only has been established for Ecosystem Services (e.g., land transformation flows)
  *  Several display errors from the PET resin supply chain have been corrected 
  *  Several outdated and duplicate flows have been eliminated and flow nomenclature improved
  
Please see the complete [Change Log](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/release_info/change-log.md) for details.

Note, shortly there will be a version 2 of this 2019 Winter (Q4) release that will eliminate CORRIM data duplicates that now have updated versions available in the [USFS CORRIM Repository](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/US_Forest_Service_Forest_Products_Lab/CORRIM) on the Federal LCA Commons. This mid-quarter version will also have a complete mapping of elementary flows to the newly developed [Federal Elementary Flow List](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?dirEntryId=347251&Lab=NRMRL), developed by the EPA.

Also, note that the Federal LCA Commons has a new [landing page](https://www.lcacommons.gov/) from which you may "Browse Repositories" if you want to explore other data becoming available from Federal LCA Commons member agencies.

Additionally, please see the [How to Publish in the USLCI](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/submission_handbook/02-how-to-publish-in-the-uslci.md) section in the USLCI Data Submission Guidelines and/or contact the contact the [USLCI Data Curator](mailto:Rebe.Feraldi@lac-group.com) if you have any data/metadata publishing goals for the March 31, 2020 Spring release date. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Finally, please note that deleted datasets are always still available in an archive managed by NREL (wherein previous USLCI database versions are available at the [USLCI Downloads Page](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/release_info/release-downloads.md).

## 2019 Fall Quarter (October 23)

Currently, the Federal LCA Commons Collaboration Server is experiencing a bug so downloading repositories from the server is on hold until the issue is addressed. In the meantime, NREL has updated the [USLCI Release Downloads](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/release_info/release-downloads.md) page to include the current USLCI release version. The JSON-LD and ILCD file sizes are larger than ecoSpold2 so these links will re-direct you to a Dropbox page to download the zip files. If importing the files into openLCA, leave the files zipped and select from the openLCA importer tool.

For many users, the JSON-LD (zipped) formats will be the most useful since they are not subject to data/metadata loss when imported into [openLCA].  The other formats are subject to data loss in certain use cases. For example, using ILCD format of the USLCI will result in the loss of comments associated with individual exchanges. EcoSpold file formats only contain processes so flows, indicators, & background data are excluded.

## 2019 Fall Quarter (September 30)
The USLCI quarterly update slated for September 30 ocurred on October 3, 2019. Several improvements and additions were made to the database available on the [NREL USLCI repo](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search/page=1&group=National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory) of the [Federal LCA Commons Collaboration Server](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search) including:

  * Technospheric flows (processes and products) have been re-categorized to be aligned with the NAICS folder structure being adapted by repos of the Federal LCA Commons
  *  The EPA Data Quality System is now integrated into the USLCI to be aligned with the system being adapted by the repos of the Federal LCA Commons (see the [relevant section in the USLCI Data Submission Guidelines](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/submission_handbook/04-resources/04-App-G.md#using-the-us-epa-data-quality-matrix-in-openlca) for details on how to use this system in openLCA)
  *  Updated PET data (and supply chain links) from NAPCOR/ACC are now available
  *  New electronic scanner data are available from Kodak-Alaris
  *  Agricultural, utility, and transport products have been decoupled from the geographic and temporal scope of their parent processes to eliminate duplicate flows and allow end-users to designate a default provider for products having more than one parent process in openLCA
  *  Several conversion factors have been inserted for natural gas and CO2 emissions corrected for diesel combustion
  *  Coal extraction data have been phased out as they are now superceded by those available in the [NETL Coal Repository](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search/page=1&group=National_Energy_Technology_Lab) on the Federal LCA Commons.
  *  Several outdated and duplicate flows have been eliminated and flow nomenclature improved
  
Please see the complete [Change Log](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/release_info/change-log.md) for details.

The Federal LCA Commons has a new [landing page](https://www.lcacommons.gov/) from which you may "Browse Repositories" if you want to explore other data becoming available from Federal LCA Commons member agencies.

Additionally, please see the [How to Publish in the USLCI](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/submission_handbook/02-how-to-publish-in-the-uslci.md) section in the USLCI Data Submission Guidelines and/or contact the contact the [USLCI Data Curator](mailto:Rebe.Feraldi@lac-group.com) if you have any data/metadata publishing goals for the December 31, 2019 Winter release date. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Finally, please note that deleted datasets are always still available in an archive managed by NREL (wherein previous USLCI database versions are available at the [USLCI Downloads Page](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/release_info/release-downloads.md).

## 2019 Summer Quarter (June 30)
The USLCI quarterly update occurred on June 30, 2019. The most recent udate of the [USLCI Database](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search/page=1&group=National_Renewable_Energy_Laboratory) is now available on the [Federal LCA Commons Collaboration Server](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search), which contains multiple group repositories. For this update, there was a display correction for the hydrogen synthesis dataset, some corrections to the allocation settings for some wood manufacturing processes, and several deletions of old providers. Please see the complete [Change Log](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/release_info/change-log.md) for details.

Additionally, please see the [How to Publish in the USLCI](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/submission_handbook/02-how-to-publish-in-the-uslci.md) in the USLCI Data Submission Guidelines and/or contact the contact the [USLCI Data Curator](mailto:Rebe.Feraldi@lac-group.com) if you have any data/metadata publishing goals for the September 30, Fall 2019 release date. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

NREL is publishing a coordination report to provide information about the US Federal Life Cycle Assessment Commons (FLCAC). The FLCAC is not only a public data source but also a repository for data developed under Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy (EERE) programs. The FLCAC Commons Working Group is coordinating and focusing efforts to improve the standardization of data documentation, formatting, and nomenclature to ensure lossless data loading and accurate data representation in the repository server. The report introduces LCA within EERE programs, describes the current status of the FLCAC, and iterates opportunities for the FLCAC to support EERE goals and objectives. See the [full Coordination Report here](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/coordination_report/toc.md).

Finally a note of explanation on database deletions in updates on which we have received inquiries: Datasets deleted are always still available in an archive managed by NREL (previous USLCI database versions are available on the main Wiki's [USLCI Release Downloads](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/release_info/release-downloads.md) page. However, when the [Change Logs](https://github.com/uslci-admin/uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/release_info/change-log.md) indicate the dataset was an "outdated provider," this means that there is a newer (i.e., more updated) equivalent dataset available in the database from the same data compiler. An example for the last dataset was petroleum refining compiled by ERG--there were 2 petroleum refining datasets from the ERG but one was outdated and many users were unsure as to which one to select for linking in upstream processes. One of the main issues with this instance is that one was referred to as "crude oil refining" and the other as "petroleum refining"--however, they referred to the same process. This occurred because nomenclature standards continue to be improved as the USLCI strives to coordinate with other agencies in the multi-agency collaboration that is the Federal LCA Commons. NREL will continue to resolve these types of issues in the USLCI by including only the latest (i.e., most appropriate) datasets for performing LCAs. An exception is if you were performing a retrospective study and even then, some of the methodologies are updated from one provider to another. Please let me know if you have further questions regarding this issue or archived datasets. The same explanation applies to corrugated products--these datasets have been updated so the older ones are no longer intended for use but are still available in archived versions of the USLCI database.
