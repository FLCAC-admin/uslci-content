## Using Issues and Discussions

### Issues

Issues are generally intended to report bugs and request enhancements related to the topic of that GitHub repository. 
It is helpful if issues have a clear path towards resolution.

- Please [apply labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels#applying-a-label) to issues to help keep them organized. The list of labels available in each repository can be viewed via the Labels button on the Issues tab (e.g., [FLCAC-Curation labels](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-Curation/labels)).
- Examples of content ideal for issues:
    - Did you find an incorrect flow mapping or conversion factor in the [All Mappings](https://dmap-data-commons-ord.s3.amazonaws.com/fedelemflowlist/All_Mappings.xlsx) file? 
    Post an issue here: [fedelemflowlist](https://github.com/USEPA/fedelemflowlist)
    - Suggest a [targeted enhancement to the FEDEFL](https://github.com/USEPA/fedelemflowlist/issues/137).

### Discussions
For topics with a wider scope or where more discussion may be required to reach a resolution, please post it as a discussion topic. 

Please apply labels to help keep the discussion list organized. 
Discussions rely on the same set of repository-specific labels used by Issues (e.g., [FLCAC-Curation labels](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-Curation/labels)).
