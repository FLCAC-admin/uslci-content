Retrieved on [DATE] from [URL for this dataset].\r\n\r\nThis dataset is part of the NETL Unit Process Library.  The Library offers additional information concerning this dataset in the form of a Detailed Spreadsheet  Documentation (DS) file and a Process Documentation File (DF).  The DS file  is an Excel file that contains all of the parameters, inputs, and outputs for a given system as well as background data, calculations and quality scores.  The DF file is a PDF document that contains major assumptions and data sources that are the basis for each unit process.  The NETL Unit Process Library is located on the NETL website (netl.doe.gov) under Research / Energy Analysis / Energy Trends and Issues / Life Cycle Analysis / Unit Process Library.\r\n\r\nFull citations for the DS and DF are given below:\r\n\r\nDS File\r\nNational Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). 2013.
