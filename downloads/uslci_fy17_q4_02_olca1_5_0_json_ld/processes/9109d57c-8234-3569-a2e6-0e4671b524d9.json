It does so using transportation modal allocation from the USDA Ethanol Backgrounder (2007), assuming this current allocation will apply in 2022. Distances for each mode are from a combination of references; still missing a good distance estimate for barge, but since the share of barge transportation is ~2%, the final result will not be sensititive to this parameter.Infrastructure impacts are included in this process by calling the Ecoinvent \"transport\" processes.\nThe production of corn grain feedstock utilized in this transport process allocates inputs to the stover and grain based on the amount of ethanol that can be produced from each co-product (so-called \"EtOH allocation\").","version":"00.00.000","lastChange":"2013-10-22T11:00:28-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"73508fc7-9b85-440f-95b8-b6e031fdc7fa","name":"Biomass"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"RNA"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"2010","technologyDescription":"future","restrictionsDescription":"All information can be accessed by everybody.","copyright":false,"validFrom":"2010-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","validUntil":"2100-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","creationDate":"2013-10-22T11:00:28-06:00","geographyDescription":"North America","dataDocumentor":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4abc5016-b922-34c0-a2c1-136c5cfa7083","name":"Garvin Heath"},"dataGenerator":{"@type":"Actor","@id":"4abc5016-b922-34c0-a2c1-136c5cfa7083","name":"Garvin Heath"},"publication":{"@type":"Source","@id":"a1d1d73e-7d93-3a6b-a3bc-3b2f4f025b86","name":"Hsu, D.
