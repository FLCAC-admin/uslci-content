This process includes galvanized sheet as the metal feedstock.  Raw materials include all known pre-treatments, cleaners, paints, and packaging materials to protect the finished sheets--as well as inbound transport.  Manufacturing processes require electricity, heat from natural gas, and process water.  Air and water emissions are captured in the output of the process.","version":"00.00.000","lastChange":"2014-05-16T16:52:45-06:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"a5e543f8-d1f6-41a9-9ed2-2d3fe8b855a8","name":"Architectural and Structural Metals Manufacturing"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"b320e7db-c758-3ba6-8839-81eb83c9d7d7","name":"RNA"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","technologyDescription":"Coil coating of galvanized steel sheet.
